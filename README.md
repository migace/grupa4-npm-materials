# NPM

## What it is?
The repository contains materials showing the use of the npm tool. The package.json file contains dependencies - i.e. packages necessary to run the project, which we can install by issuing the `npm i` command. Additionally, there is a list of scripts that we can run, e.g. `npm run start`

## How to run it?
```
npm i
npm run start
```
